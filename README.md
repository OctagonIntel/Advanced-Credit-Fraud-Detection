# **Credit Card Fraud Detection Project**



##### **Project Overview:**



This project simulates a realistic data science and analytics workflow to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model, followed by data exploration and dashboard visualization.



The project covers:



Data cleaning and exploration in Python

Fraud detection model using Logistic Regression

Post-model analysis with BigQuery SQL

Interactive dashboard in Power BI

This showcases both technical ability and business acumen in handling a classic real-world problem.



##### **Objectives:**



Identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning

Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data

Analyze prediction outcomes using SQL

Visualize results for non-technical stakeholders



##### **Tools:**



* Kaggle Case
* Python 
* Jupyter Notebooks
* BigQuery	
* Power BI





##### **Model Performance:**



A Logistic Regression model was trained on the dataset using scaled numeric features. The predictions were saved and compared against actual fraud labels to evaluate:



True Positives/Negatives

False Positives/Negatives



##### **SQL Analysis (BigQuery):**



Data was uploaded into BigQuery where SQL queries were used to:



Count each prediction category

Calculate fraud rates

Explore country- or amount-based fraud distributions



##### **Power BI Dashboard:**



The dashboard summarizes:

Total transactions and fraud cases

Model prediction outcomes

Fraud rate comparisons

Time-based fraud trend



##### **Summary**



This project demonstrates core skills expected from a data analyst or entry-level data scientist: from raw data to model to meaningful business insights.
